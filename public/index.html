<!--
    This is an HTML file for a simple websocket chat application.

    The structure of the chat interface is as follows:
    - h1: Displays a welcome message
    - div#feed: Contains a message feed that displays all messages received from the server.
    - div#allPosts: Contains all the messages received from the server.
    - form: The chat interface's input form.
      - label for="username": Displays the label for the username input field.
      - input#username: The input field for the user's username.
      - label for="newMessage": Displays the label for the new message input field.
      - input#newMessage: The input field for the user's new message.
      - button: The submit button for the form.
    - script: The Socket.IO client library.
    - script: The JavaScript file that handles the interaction between the client and server.

    When the user submits the form, the script.js file emits a 'message' event to the server with the username and message as payload. The server then broadcasts the message to all clients.

    When the server receives a 'message' event, it logs the message to the console and broadcasts the message to all clients.

    The script.js file also handles the 'Welcome' event emitted by the server. When this event is received, it logs the data to the console.

    The Socket.IO client library is included in the HTML file using the <script> tag.

    The server-side code is in the server.js file. It sets up Express.js and serves the public folder. It also sets up Socket.IO and listens for the 'connect' event. When a client connects, it logs the connection and emits a 'Welcome' event to the client. It also listens for the 'message' event and broadcasts the message to all clients.

    The client-side JavaScript file, script.js, handles the interaction between the client and server. It initializes a Socket.IO connection to the server and listens for the 'message' event. When this event is emitted by the server, it updates the DOM with the message received. It also listens for the 'submit' event on the form element and prevents the default form submission behavior. It retrieves the username and message from the form inputs, creates a data object with these values, and emits the 'message' event to the server with the data object as payload.
